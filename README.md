### Built-in Player

Nuvio ships with **AetherEngine** — a free, built-in player with native tvOS controls, subtitle support, resume, audio delay adjustment, and frame-rate matching. **MPVKit** stays as a fallback for edge cases AetherEngine doesn't cover yet (including audio amplification, separate video/audio streams, and full ASS typesetting).

#### AetherEngine vs Infuse

| **Custom HTTP headers (Referer/User-Agent)** | ✅ Built-in relay & custom headers | ❌ Standard URLs only |
| **Trakt & Simkl scrobbling** | ✅ Built-in (custom API apps) | 🔌 Trakt only (Simkl not supported) |
| **Separate video+audio URLs** | ⚠️ MPVKit fallback | ❌ Not supported |

### Trakt sign-in with your own API app

Nuvio supports Trakt device login with user-provided API credentials. This is useful when you want to use your own Trakt application instead of relying on shared app credentials.

1. Create an application at [trakt.tv/oauth/applications](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications).
2. Set its redirect URI to `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`.
3. On Apple TV, go to **Settings → Integrations → Trakt**, then enter the Trakt Client ID and Client Secret.
4. Choose **Connect with Trakt**, scan the QR code or enter its code at `trakt.tv/activate`, and approve the connection.

The Client ID and Client Secret are stored only on that Apple TV; they are deliberately excluded from Nuvio account/profile sync. Changing either credential disconnects the old Trakt session so it cannot be reused with a different application.

### Simkl sign-in with your own API app

Nuvio supports Simkl TV PIN login with a user-provided Client ID.

1. Create an application in [Simkl developer settings](https://simkl.com/settings/developer/).
2. Use `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` as the redirect URI when configuring the application.
3. On Apple TV, go to **Settings → Integrations → Simkl** and enter its Client ID.
4. Choose **Connect with Simkl**, scan the QR code, and enter the displayed PIN at `simkl.com/pin`.

Simkl's PIN flow does not need a Client Secret. The Client ID stays on that Apple TV and is excluded from Nuvio sync; the access token is stored in the current profile's Keychain.

### Notes

- Content availability depends on your configured sources and their upstream services.
- The Apple TV Simulator cannot play AV1. ASS/SSA positioning and typesetting use the app subtitle style.

## About

This repository started as a fork of the Nuvio mobile app. The focus of this fork is now the tvOS version: a native SwiftUI Apple TV app under [tvosApp](./tvosApp) with Apple TV navigation, focus handling, profile selection, catalog browsing, details screens, search, library/watchlist surfaces, and playback controls designed for the Siri Remote.

The original shared mobile code is still present in [composeApp](./composeApp), with the inherited iOS app under [iosApp](./iosApp). The active tvOS development surface is [tvosApp/NuvioTV](./tvosApp/NuvioTV).

## Current tvOS App

- Native SwiftUI entry point in [NuvioTVApp.swift](./tvosApp/NuvioTV/Sources/NuvioTVApp.swift).
- Apple TV tab navigation for Profile, Home, Search, Library, and Settings.
- Home rows for synced Nuvio collections and configured catalog lists.
- Catalog and metadata repository with configurable catalog, playback, and subtitle integrations.
- User-configurable source integrations in Settings → Integrations → Add-ons.
- Cloud library playback through supported connected services.
- Apple TV Top Shelf extension backed by the active Continue Watching row.
- Long-press quick actions for poster cards, including details, library toggle, and watched toggle.
- QR-code and email login flow backed by Supabase configuration in [AuthConfig.swift](./tvosApp/NuvioTV/Sources/Core/Auth/AuthConfig.swift).
- tvOS profile/account sync for profiles, add-ons, settings, library, watched state, and progress. Settings follow the selected profile across Apple TVs; device-only app credentials stay local.
- Trakt device-code login using a user-provided Client ID and Client Secret, stored locally on the Apple TV.
- Simkl PIN login, watched-history sync, Plan to Watch library sync, playback progress, and scrobbling.
- New AetherEngine-first player with Siri Remote controls, precise seeking and resume, embedded/add-on subtitle support, saved track selections, frame-rate matching, and a one-way MPVKit compatibility fallback.
- Pure Swift app core (no Nuvio Rust / FFI dependency).
- tvOS app assets, splash screen, top shelf images, and Apple TV app icon stack in [Images.xcassets](./tvosApp/NuvioTV/Images.xcassets).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution rules, testing notes, and issue-reporting guidance.

## Requirements

- macOS with Xcode installed.
- Apple TV simulator runtime installed in Xcode.
- [Tuist](https://tuist.dev) to generate the Xcode project. Install it with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev): `mise install` picks up the pinned version from [mise.toml](./mise.toml).
- Network access for catalog metadata, source lookups, and Swift Package resolution.

The Xcode project is **generated by Tuist and is not tracked in git**. Edit [tvosApp/Project.swift](./tvosApp/Project.swift) rather than the `.xcodeproj`, then re-run `tuist generate`. Source files are picked up by glob, so adding a file needs no project edit at all.

The app targets Apple TV (`SDKROOT = appletvos`) with bundle id `com.pyksel.nuviotvos` and a tvOS 17.5 deployment target, all declared in `Project.swift`.

## Setup

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <your-fork-url> NuvioTVOS
cd NuvioTVOS
```

> **Note:** If you already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, initialize the submodules before generating the project:
> ```bash
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> ```

Install the pinned toolchain and generate the Xcode project:

```bash
mise install
cd tvosApp
tuist generate
```

`tuist generate` opens the workspace in Xcode. Use `--no-open` to only write it.


Use the `NuvioTV` scheme and an Apple TV simulator.

## Running

The helper script builds the native tvOS app, installs it on the first booted Apple TV simulator, and launches it:

```bash
./scripts/run-mobile.sh tvos s
```

If no Apple TV simulator is booted, open Simulator or Xcode first and start one, then rerun the command.

You can also build directly with Xcode:

```bash
(cd tvosApp && tuist generate --no-open)
xcodebuild \
  -workspace tvosApp/NuvioTV.xcworkspace \
  -scheme NuvioTV \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'generic/platform=tvOS Simulator' \
  build
```

## Configuration

Account login is optional during development. The login screen supports "Continue without account" so the tvOS UI can be tested without backend credentials.

To enable QR login and email auth, fill in the Supabase values in:

```text
tvosApp/NuvioTV/Sources/Core/Auth/AuthConfig.swift
```

Catalogs and metadata use configurable catalog, playback, and subtitle endpoints from [CatalogRepository.swift](./tvosApp/NuvioTV/Sources/Data/Repository/CatalogRepository.swift).

## Tests

Unit tests live in [tvosApp/NuvioTVTests](./tvosApp/NuvioTVTests).

[tvosApp/NuvioTVUITests](./tvosApp/NuvioTVUITests) contains UI test sources that no target currently builds; see [docs/tuist-migration.md](./docs/tuist-migration.md).

Run tests from Xcode, or with:

```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -workspace tvosApp/NuvioTV.xcworkspace \
  -scheme NuvioTV \
  -destination 'platform=tvOS Simulator,name=Apple TV'
```

Some older verification scripts in `tvosApp/` still carry inherited iOS wording. Prefer the Xcode build/test commands above as the source of truth for the tvOS target.

## Project Structure

- `tvosApp/NuvioTV/` contains the native SwiftUI tvOS app.
- `tvosApp/NuvioTV/Sources/UI/` contains the Apple TV screens and reusable components.
- `tvosApp/NuvioTV/Sources/ViewModels/` contains the Swift view models for tvOS flows.
- `tvosApp/NuvioTV/Sources/Data/Repository/` contains catalog, metadata, source, and subtitle fetching.
- `tvosApp/NuvioTV/Sources/Core/Auth/` contains Supabase email and TV QR-login support.
- `MPVKit/` is the local Swift Package used for playback.
- `composeApp/` and `iosApp/` are inherited from the mobile fork and remain useful references while tvOS functionality is ported.

## Built With

- SwiftUI and UIKit focus/input bridging for tvOS
- AetherEngine and MPVKit playback engines
- Configurable catalog, source, and subtitle APIs
- Kotlin Multiplatform / Compose Multiplatform code inherited from the mobile fork
